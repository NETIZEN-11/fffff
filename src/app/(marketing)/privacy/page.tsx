    body: "We use your content to provide the analysis, cover letter, and rewriting features you request. We use usage data to improve the product, detect abuse, and prioritise engineering work.

    title: "Sub-processors",
    body: "We use the following sub-processors to deliver the Service: Supabase (database and file storage), OpenAI (AI analysis — your content is sent to OpenAI to generate results, see OpenAI's data usage policy), Stripe (payments), Inngest (background jobs), and Resend (transactional email). Each is contractually required to protect your data.",

  {
    title: "Your rights (GDPR / CCPA)",
    body: "You can request a copy of all data we hold about you, correct inaccurate data, or delete your account entirely. Account self-deletion is available at Settings → Danger Zone; data export is available at Settings → Export. For data requests we cannot service directly, email privacy@resumerank.ai and we will respond within 30 days.",

    title: "Security",
    body: "We encrypt data in transit (TLS) and at rest (Supabase AES-256). Passwords are hashed with bcrypt. We use session cookies with HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Lax flags. We log security events and run quarterly access reviews. No system is 100% secure — please use a strong, unique password.",
